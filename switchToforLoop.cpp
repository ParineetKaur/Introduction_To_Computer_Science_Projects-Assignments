//Rewrite the following while loop as a for loop:

//int i = 0;

//while (i < 50){

//if (i < 20 && i != 15){

//cout << 'X';

//}

//i++;
//}

for(int i = 0; i < 50; i++){
  if (i < 20 && i != 15){
    cout << 'X';
  }
}

//Always read the code you have to change carefully because (in this code, specfically) we had to use if statement along with for loop.
